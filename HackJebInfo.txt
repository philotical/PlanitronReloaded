Mechjeb 1.9.8 base code update.

Before I start, all credit goes to the MechJeb team who created a wonderful platform for expansion.

I've updated the default mech jeb client to include new features:

VAB

    Show a price of your ship

Vessel Info

    Reduce info update rate to 2x per second for better performance
    Current total thrust.
    Current thrust to weight ratio.
    Show current Acceleration delta.
    Show current change in acceleration delta.
    Show current distance until Delta V is zero, useful for landing
    Show current time until Delta V is zero, useful for fuel consumption
    Show true altitude in vessel info.
    Engine efficiency, helps tune throttle for best use of fuel. Larger number is better
    Fuel flow - current total fuel flow.
    Time scale. Provides the ability to slow down game time up to 20x slower. this is a must for launch large ships.

Planitron

    Provides a way to set Kerbin to the characteristics of any other celestial body. This is extremely helpful for testing out remote return crafts, or rovers.
